               <h1>A Bit of History About Our Industry</h1>
               <h2>Place some images inside here</h2>
               <p>The electronic cigarette industry has seen tremendous growth in the last several years. In a recent study by Wells Fargo Research, 100% of surveyed tobacco re-sellers and wholesalers, representing over 45,000 U.S. convenience stores, are now selling electronic cigarettes, and 98% of them reported growing sales in the first quarter of 2013. It is estimated that the electronic cigarette industry has really become a competitor for the tobacco business, and could reach $3 billion in sales in 2015, more than triple the $300-$500 million registered in 2012. Currently, the tobacco industry is an $80 billion dollar industry, and less than one percent is currently being segmented by electronic cigarettes. This says a lot about what smokers are starting to realize about the tobacco giants. People are starting to recognize that there are better opportunities for them out there. While this may be sad news for the tobacco industry, it is great news for the mom and pop shops that built this great country of ours. Small businesses like ours are what make this country great, and our company is excited to see an industry built by small business.</p>
